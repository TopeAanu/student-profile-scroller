# Student Profile Scroller 

While implementing, I developed a project: a scrollable app that collects a few details of university students. you can check it out through the link: [student-profiles](https://uni-student-profs.netlify.app/)

This app utilizes the next() method to iterate through the objects stored in the data array, which basically allows the app to process each object in the data array one at a time.
